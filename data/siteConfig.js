  authorDescription: `My family came as refugees from Vietnam and we were sponsored by a church that helped us settle in the Twin Cities.  
  Growing up navigating multiple cultures, my service globally, travels to 22 countries, experience teaching in Higher Ed., work with African refugees and diverse organizations 
  have led me to see the importance of growing in 
  cultural and racial intelligence and competency.  <br/><br/>
  I educate, speak on and provide training in cultural competency, racial justice, ethnic diversity, immigration & refugee advocacy and Asian American topics.
  <br/><br/>
  I am a Qualified Administrator of the IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) a premier tool that assesses intercultural competency.   
  <br/><br/>
  Learning should be fun, engagin, and thought provoking so I employ a variety of teaching methods such as cultural assessment tools, games, workshops, discussion and interactive simulations. My passion is to see people and organizations embrace an equitable multi-ethnic lifestyle and practices that impact communities locally and globally.
  <br/><br/>
  I can customize my trainings from a 30 min speaking engagement, 1 hour webinar, 1/2 - full day interactive workshop, to a 5 week virtual series.  I'd love to work with you or adapt to fit your needs.
