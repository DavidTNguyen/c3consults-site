  authorDescription: `My family came as refugees from Vietnam in 1975 and we were introduced to the gospel of Jesus Christ
  through the church that sponsored us. We have followed the Lord ever since. I am married to David
  with two delightful children (Mỹ Linh and Khoa) who attend a Chinese immersion school. My
  experiences as a YWAM missionary, Short-Term Mission director serving around the world, and
  university professor teaching courses in race, culture, and ministry have shaped my passion for training
  others to grow in cultural competency. I’ve been in leadership with multi-ethnic churches since 1998, and
  my current role walking alongside African refugees has also enriched my understanding and teaching.`,
