  authorDescription: `My family came as refugees from Vietnam and we were sponsored by a church that helped us settle in the Twin Cities.  
  Growing up navigating multiple cultures, my service globally, travels to 22 countries,, experience as a university professor, work with African refugees and diverse organizations 
  have led me to see the importance of growing in 
  cultural and racial intelligence and competency.  <br/><br/>
  I educate, speak on and provide training in cultural competency, racial justice, ethnic diversity, immigration & refugee advocacy and Asian American topics.
  <br/><br/>
  I am a Qualified Administrator of the IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) a premier tool that assesses intercultural competency.   
  <br/><br/>
  I enjoy using a variety of teaching methods such as cultural assessment tools, interactive games, workshops, and simulations.  
  My passion is to see people and organizations embrace an equitable multi-ethnic lifestyle and practices that impact communities locally and globally.
  <br/><br/>
  I can customize my trainings from a 30 min "Ted Talk", 1 hour presentation, 3 hour interactive workshop, to a 5 week virtual series.  I can work with you to fit your needs.
