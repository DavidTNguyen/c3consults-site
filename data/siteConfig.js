  authorDescription: `My family came as refugees from Vietnam in 1975 and we were sponsored by a church that helped us settle in the Twin Cities.  
  Growing up navigating multiple cultrues, my travels and service globally, experience as a professor, work with African refugees and diverse organizations 
  have led me to see the importance of cultural and racial intelligence and competence.  <br/><br/>
  I educate, speak on and provide training in cultural competency, racial justice, ethnic diversity, immigration & refugee advocacy and Asian American topics.
  <br/><br/>
  I am certified in the IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory), and use a variety of teaching methods such as cultural assessment tools, interactive games, workshops, and simulations.  
  My passion is to see people and organizations embrace an equitable multi-ethnic lifestyle and practices that impact communities locally and abroad.
