    quote: "Khanh Nguyen is a fantastic facilitator and speaker.  I brought her to speak to my college leadership program and she did a phenomenal job!  With over 80 students from various ethnic, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds students across the board admitted to feeling challenged to have more intentionality, work to understand others, and apply what they learned from Khanh to their leadership pursuits.  Her humor, wit and ability to relate things to students of various faiths was refreshing.  I am already working on an invitation to bring Khanh back again!",

    quote: "Understanding cultural differences is a critical part of being a good neighbor. Many individuals have best intentions, however their lack of recognizing bias, privilege, assumptions, and worldview differences leads to major gaps in communication with other ethnic groups. Khanh Nguyen provides practical, easy to understand tools to help navigate many cultural land mines that typically are overlooked. UpWorks, a Christian nonprofit, has integrated Khanh’s Cultural Awareness training as a part of its “Life Advocate’ program that involve mentor and clients from diverse backgrounds. Life Advocates walk beside Upworks clients utilizing these all important skills Khanh introduces. If your church or organization works with people from variant ethnic backgrounds perhaps considering the Cultural Awareness training Khanh offers will make the difference needed. I highly recommend her to you!",

    quote: "Khanh Nguyen did a fabulous job leading our entire staff through cultural awareness training. Her pre-workshop assessments provided helpful data to launch our retreat.  Khanh is a gifted leader and educator who not only knew her content thoroughly, but also presented it in an engaging way.  Our staff loved the games and diverse teaching styles that were implemented. Most of all, every participant commented how our world-view was opened and advanced through Khanh’s personal and Christ-centered presentation.  I would highly recommend her presentation to anyone.",
