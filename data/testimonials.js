      'Khanh Nguyễn is a fantastic facilitator and speaker.  I brought her to speak to my college leadership program and she did a phenomenal job!  With over 80 students from various ethnic, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds students across the board admitted to feeling challenged to have more intentionality, work to understand others, and apply what they learned from Khanh to their leadership pursuits.  Her humor, wit and ability to relate things to students of various faiths was refreshing.  I am already working on an invitation to bring Khanh back again!',

    quote:
      "I invited Khanh to lead workshops on race, culture and Asian American women in leadership for my college student leader's training. I was impressed with the way she incorporated activities to help my students understand and contextualize difficult topics like systemic racism, white privilege, cultural nuances among other topics. What I appreciated most about Khanh is her perspective as a Vietnamese-American woman. There aren't enough Asian voices represented in this space and Khanh has been able to use her years of professional experience in predominantly white higher ed spaces to push the status quo rather than backing down when there's push back. Her resilient faith paired with her heart for justice is a force to be reckoned with. ",

    title: 'Associate Pastor of Formation - Sanctuary Cov',
    quote:
      'Bold truth-telling paired with biblical and theological faithfulness is a core competency in faith-based leadership today. Khanh Nguyễn embodies this convergence of expertise as an academician, facilitator, preacher, and woman of God. I have seen her take contentious, divisive, and complex topics regarding faith, race, politics, and economics and apply a thick theological framing where others often resign to a thin theology that is void of relevant application. Khanh marries theory and practice and offers a robust praxis for audiences around the Twin Cities and beyond. Khanh’s voice is integral in this moment in the Church and its gritty application in real life, and she does it all with courage, wit, intentionality, and grace. Khanh has something to offer not many possess and any organization or individual considering their next steps toward faith-filled cultural competency needs to contact Khanh Nguyen.',

    title: 'Director for Empowering and Restoring Adults – UpWorks',
    quote:
      'Understanding cultural differences is a critical part of being a good neighbor. Many individuals have best intentions, however their lack of recognizing bias, privilege, assumptions, and worldview differences leads to major gaps in communication with other ethnic groups. Khanh provides practical, easy to understand tools to help navigate many cultural land mines that typically are overlooked. UpWorks, has integrated Khanh’s Cultural Awareness training as a part of its “Life Advocate’ program that involve mentors and clients from diverse backgrounds. Life Advocates walk beside Upworks clients utilizing these all important skills Khanh introduces. If your church or organization works with people from diverse backgrounds I highly recommend Khanh to you!',
