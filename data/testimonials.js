    "quote": "Khanh Nguyễn is a fantastic facilitator and speaker.  I brought her to speak to my college leadership program and she did a phenomenal job!  With over 80 students from various ethnic, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds students across the board admitted to feeling challenged to have more intentionality, work to understand others, and apply what they learned from Khanh to their leadership pursuits.  Her humor, wit and ability to relate things to students of various faiths was refreshing.  I am already working on an invitation to bring Khanh back again!",

    "quote": "Understanding cultural differences is a critical part of being a good neighbor. Many individuals have best intentions, however their lack of recognizing bias, privilege, assumptions, and worldview differences leads to major gaps in communication with other ethnic groups. Khanh provides practical, easy to understand tools to help navigate many cultural land mines that typically are overlooked. UpWorks, has integrated Khanh’s Cultural Awareness training as a part of its “Life Advocate’ program that involve mentors and clients from diverse backgrounds. Life Advocates walk beside Upworks clients utilizing these all important skills Khanh introduces. If your church or organization works with people from diverse backgrounds I highly recommend Khanh to you!",

    "quote": "Bold truth-telling paired with biblical and theological faithfulness is a core competency in faith-based leadership today. Khanh Nguyễn embodies this convergence of expertise as an academician, facilitator, preacher, and woman of God. I have seen her take contentious, divisive, and complex topics regarding faith, race, politics, and economics and apply a thick theological framing where others often resign to a thin theology that is void of relevant application. Khanh marries theory and practice and offers a robust praxis for audiences around the Twin Cities and beyond. Khanh’s voice is integral in this moment in the Church and its gritty application in real life, and she does it all with courage, wit, intentionality, and grace. Khanh has something to offer not many possess and any organization or individual considering their next steps toward faith-filled cultural competency needs to contact Khanh Nguyen.",

    "quote": "Khanh Nguyễn brings a raw authenticity to her instruction and teaching that is both rare and powerful. Her unique story and experience in the areas of race, culture, and justice give her immense credibility for almost any sociological, theological, or other topic. She brings audiences with her on journeys of triumph and pain while motivating them to fulfill the calling of Christ in the world.",
